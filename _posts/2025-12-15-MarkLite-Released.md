MarkLite is an open-source, lightweight Markdown Viewer and Editor for Linux. I wrote MarkLite out of frustration for having to load a feature-heavy Markdown editor to just view or make a quick change. I developed MarkLite in Dart/Flutter and it was one of my first attempts to write a platform application in that language/framework combination.

**Overview**

Basically the way MarkLite works is it opens in a viewer mode. You can either read the Markdown document then close it or simply click the Edit button to edit it. Edit mode is a full features edit with features like Find, Got Line, Line Numbers, Syntax Highlighting and Key Commands.

**Features** 
- Lightweight application that loads fast.
- Can be set as your default viewer for Markdown files.
- Viewer/Editor modes.
- Offers a light and dark mode.
- Editor has basic functionality for quick edits.
- Common keyboard shortcuts in editor.
- Find/Replace in editor.
- GoTo Line feature in editor.
- Line numbering in editor for convenience.
- Markdown syntax highlighting in editor.

**Final Thoughts** 

Remember that MarkLite is a lightweight viewer/editor and does not have the full editor/IDE dynamic syntax analysis and other features.
This application is focused on being a fast viewer with light editing, not a feature rich editor.
