My daily work requires me to send or post links fairly regularly and I have always been a fan of URL shorteners. Unfortunately, most of these tools today are nothing but advertising platforms and data collection silos. So, I decided to write my own and make it respect both member's and users' privacy.

I used Rails 6 / Ruby 2.6 with Postgres deployed on Heroku to craft this tool. It has simple use analytics (if you create a simple account) and does not collect identifying info on visitors as I use  [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/)  for my analytics on the site. Check it out and feel free to use it if you like.

I will be opening up the repo making the app open source once I have finished cleaning up the code to a point I feel comfortable releasing it.

***Please note: 2023-01-27 I have taken this app down as I no longer need it for work. I hope to make the repo public soon.***
