Birmingham, Alabama (February 2nd, 2026) **ResizeAll**, the easy-to-use batch image resizer for Windows and Linux, today announced the release of version 0.2.0, bringing usability improvement for web developers and everyday users alike:   

**Optional image orientation normalization that converts EXIF orientation metadata into the correct physical orientation during processing.**  

Many cameras and phones store the intended rotation of a photo in EXIF Orientation metadata rather than rotating the pixels themselves. Some apps respect that metadata, while others don’t—leading to images that appear sideways or upside down in certain contexts. ResizeAll 0.2.0 addresses this with a new prompt that appears when a batch of images is loaded. If the app detects camera-orientation metadata, users can choose to normalize orientation so resized outputs display correctly everywhere, while keeping original images safe and untouched.

**What’s new in ResizeAll 0.2.0**

- Updated to the latest Dart and Flutter framework version.  
- Optional EXIF Orientation Normalization: When opening a folder, ResizeAll can detect images that include orientation metadata and ask whether to apply it—baking rotation/flip into the resized output for consistent viewing across apps and platforms.  
- Optimized Processing Code: Improvements under the hood help ResizeAll run more efficiently during batch operations, reducing overhead while maintaining high-quality resizing results.  
- Refactoring of code that loads images to enhance performance.  
- New About Dialog: A redesigned About window makes it easier to view version details, contact information, and the official project website.  

“ResizeAll is built to be simple, fast, and dependable,” said Mike Chilson, author of ResizeAll. “Version 0.2.0 removes a common frustration with photo resizing... Unexpected rotation while also improving performance and polishing the overall experience.”
