I was thinking the other day about the tools I use on a daily basis when doing web development and decided to do do a short post on my "go-to" Chrome add-on's. These are popular but somewhat simplistic tools that are small, fast and don't get in your way until you need to use them. So let's get started!

[CSS Peeper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-peeper/mbnbehikldjhnfehhnaidhjhoofhpehk?hl=en)
Ever wondered what’s the line-height, font or a button size on a website? This add-on provides you the tools to satisfy your curiosity. You can inspect code in the easiest possible way. Check the hidden CSS style of objects, colors and assets on the web without digging through code.

[Pesticide](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pesticide-for-chrome/bblbgcheenepgnnajgfpiicnbbdmmooh?hl=en)
This extension inserts the Pesticide CSS temporarily into the current page, outlining each element to better see placement on the page. This is a great tool to help you align your div's and such.

[WhatFont ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en)
What is the easiest way to find out the fonts used in a webpage? With this extension, you can inspect web fonts by just hovering on them. It is that simple and elegant. It also detects the services used for serving the web fonts.

[Colorzilla ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp?hl=en)
With ColorZilla you can get a color reading from any web page or point in your browser, quickly adjust this color and paste it into another program. Get a sites' color pallet, generate CSS gradients, and many other great features. 

I hope you find these tools as useful as I do on a daily basis.
