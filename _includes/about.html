                    <strong>Want to know more about me?</strong>
                    <p>I am a freelance software developer with over 40 years of experience based in Birmingham, Alabama. I currently work within web-based technologies with a specialization in full-stack web applications, server-side API's and Native Electron Applications. I have a broad background in software development in the manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, mining and service industries, both platform-specific applications and web-based ones. Check out my Portfolio on the site menu for some examples of my recent work.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Something that sets me apart from most contract developers is I do value-based pricing. That simply means I don't force an hourly rate on projects but try to give a client a fixed cost once the deliverables are agreed upon. This shares the risk with the client making them a happy long-term returning customer when their project is delivered within budget.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am fluent in <strong>C/C++</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and of course <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS/SCSS</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong>. I regularly use the following frameworks... <strong>Rails</strong>, <strong>Sinatra</strong>, and <strong>Jekyll</strong> for Ruby. <strong>Shiny</strong> and <strong>Plumber</strong> in R. I also have working knowledge of SQL with the following database servers <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>MS SQL Server</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, and <strong>SQLite</strong>.</p>
