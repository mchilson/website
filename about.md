I am a senior freelance software developer with over 40 years of experience. I am currently working mostly web-based technologies with a specialization in full-stack web applications and server-side API's. I also can develop native applications in both Electron and Dart/Flutter. I have a broad background of software development in the manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, mining and service industries, both platform-specific applications and web-based ones. Check out my Portfolio here on the site for some examples of my recent work.

I am also involved with the open-source community having contributed, developed, deployed, and managed several open-source projects. Again, check out my portfolio for several of these.

If you have a special project in mind please contact me for my availability.
