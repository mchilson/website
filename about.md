I am a freelance software developer with over 40 years of experience based in Birmingham, Alabama. I currently work within web-based technologies with a specialization in full-stack web applications, server-side API's and Native Electron Applications. I have a broad background in software development in the manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, mining and service industries, both platform-specific applications and web-based ones. Check out my Portfolio on the site menu for some examples of my recent work.

Something that sets me apart from most contract developers is I do value-based pricing. That simply means I don't force an hourly rate on projects but try to give a client a fixed cost once the deliverables are agreed upon. This shares the risk with the client making them a happy long-term returning customer when their project is delivered within budget.
